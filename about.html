				Michael G. Lowes started Lowes’ Landscaping in 1985 as a small close customer based company. Erik Lowes, Michael’s son, took over and expanded the business in 2008 to serve residential, commercial, and municipal customers. In 2013, Erik opened Planted in Stone, the retail division of the company. Lowes Landscaping purchased Clean Cut Lawn Service and expanded its services in Fall of 2013.  The company is certified with National Concrete Masonry Association and International Concrete Paver Association
